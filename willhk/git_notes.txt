Cowboy Coder makes me want to not user git, they need to name them something less cool. Maybe Space Vigilante Coders?

Version control is awesome though, letting you keep track of all the changes made to a project.

git requires you to tell it when to save a new version of your project.

git is the best because Linus wrote it. end of story.

git is a distributed version control system. Everybody saves their own copy. 

git --version
git init NAME
README
git add FILE
git commit -a -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
git config
git status
git log  (log of all commits to the repo)
git checkout (check out a different version of the repo)
git diff calculates the different between two different versions of a repo
git checkout master (run home from the scary other forks)



commit often

git init
git status
git add
git commit -m'!!'
git push
